# Bootstrap

As `grid` system is used [Bootstrap version 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/).

## Response

The administration view is responsive, using the following break widths (defined in \_variables.scss):
- `$bp-laptop:1200px` - for widths smaller than this, the header and left menu are hidden and available by clicking on the hamburger menu.
- `$bp-tablet:992px` - for less than this width, the datatable editor is displayed in the full window area (both horizontally and vertically).
- `$bp-dinosaur:576px` - for less than this width the layout in the editor is changed - the field names are moved from the left above the field.
More is described in the section [Main controls](../../redactor/admin/README.md)
