# Thymeleaf templates

Thymeleaf is a templating framework for Spring applications. In addition to our documentation from the left menu, we also recommend reading:
- [Official documentation](https://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html)
- [Using objects from the model](https://www.baeldung.com/thymeleaf-in-spring-mvc#model)

In WebJET CMS we strictly use Thymeleaf over data attributes, so never use attributes like `th:text` but always as `data-th-text`.

The advantage of using data attributes is that it is fully possible to prototype the template outside the WebJET CMS, for example listing the page title:

```html
<span data-th-text="${docDetails.title}">Titulok str√°nky</span>
```

when executed via WebJET CMS, the static text "Page Title" is replaced by the value of the object `${docDetails.title}`. This is a general property of Thymeleaf and is applicable to any attribute (e.g. `href` vs `data-th-href`).
