# User groups

Click on the link to see a list of user groups. The system distinguishes two types of groups:
- Accesses to the password-protected section of the website - group for access rights to non-public sections of the website
- Bulk email subscription - group for email distribution list

In the dialog box for defining the group, you have the following fields:
- Name - the name of the group.
- Group Type - the type of group, either the access rights for a rights control group or a bulk email group.
- Note - any note.
- Requires approval - if checked, after registering a user to this group, an email will first be sent to the administrator to approve the registration. The user will be created in the database, but will not have the Approved field selected and will not be able to log in
- Allow adding/removing from a group by the user - if set, the user will be able to add/remove the group by themselves. Usually this is set for email groups so that the user themselves can set what distribution lists they will be subscribed to. For groups with access rights, leave unchecked.
- Require email address confirmation - if selected, a link to confirm the email address will be sent when the user registers via the registration form. Only after clicking the link in the email message will the user be assigned to the group.
- Email text page ID - selection of the email text page that will be sent to the user after approval.
