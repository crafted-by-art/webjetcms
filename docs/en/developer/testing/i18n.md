## Translations of texts

In tests, you may need to perform an action over text, but this changes according to the language of the page/administration. A helper is created [i18n](../../../../src/test/webapp/pages/i18n.js) which simplifies the translation of texts between languages. It assumes text input in English and output in the set language in `ENV` variable `CODECEPT_LNG`. The current language is obtained by `I.getConfLng()`.

The translations themselves are in the files for [Slovak](../../../../src/test/webapp/pages/i18n.sk.js) a [Czech](../../../../src/test/webapp/pages/i18n.cs.js). Translations do not have a tree structure, it is assumed that the same text is always translated in the same way. However, we recommend that when entering a large number of translations, you write in the comment which test file they come from.

If the translation should have a different meaning than the one already used, it is possible to use a suffix in the format `::append`. For English, this suffix is removed, but is used as part of the key when searching for a translation. Example: `Gallery->Galérie` a `Gallery::fbrowser->Galéria`.

The following methods are available:
- `get(text)` - translation of text from English into the set language
- `click(text, context, options)` - call compensation `I.click` with text translation
- `see(text, context)` - call compensation `I.see(text, context)` with text translation
- `waitForText(text, sec, context)` - call compensation `I.waitForText(text, sec, context)` with text translation

Examples of use:

```javascript
Scenario('filebrowser - toolbar + navbar screens', ({ I, DTE, Document, i18n }) => {
    I.clickCss('div[title="'+i18n.get('Icons view')+'"].elfinder-button');
    I.click( locate("a.nav-link").withText(i18n.get("Tools")) );
});

Scenario('filebrowser - search screens', ({ I, Document, i18n }) => {
    i18n.click("In Subfolders");
    i18n.waitForText("File indexing completed");
});
```
