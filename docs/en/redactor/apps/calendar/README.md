## Basic

The Basic tab is filled with basic information about the event. Only the name is required. The start and end of the event is automatically pre-filled according to the current day.

## Advanced

In the advanced tab you can set more detailed information about the events. It also includes [optional fields](../../../frontend/webpages/customfields/README.md) "Info 1" to "Info 5".

The choice of event type is also important. If the selected event type requires approval, an email will be sent requesting approval before the event is displayed on the web page.
