# Documentation for frontend programmer

The documentation in this section is intended for a frontend programmer who is preparing the design of a WebJET 2023-based site.

First we recommend to study the use of [Ninja framework](http://docs.webjetcms.sk/v8/#/ninja-starter-kit/) for preparing templates in WebJET CMS.

This documentation is at an early stage and highlights the main differences between the web page templates in WebJET 8 and WebJET 2023 so far. Sections not listed here are used in the same way as in WebJET 8, please use the WebJET 8 manual.
