# Configure event types

In the event types configuration, you set the event types into which the event calendar entries can be categorized.

Warning: do not use the character in the event type name `,` or `+`.

# Approval

In addition to the event type name, it is possible to [also set the approver](../non-approved-events/README.md). If specified, when a new event is created in a given type, the event does not start to appear immediately on the web page, but waits for approval by the selected approver.
