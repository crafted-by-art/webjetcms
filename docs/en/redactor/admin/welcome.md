## Bookmarks

You can add links to frequently used sections in the administration to the bookmarks mini-application. After logging in, you don't have to search for the section in the menu, but you can directly click on the link in the bookmarks.

Click the orange icon to the left of the Bookmarks text to open a dialog box in which you specify the name of the bookmark and the address to open when you click the bookmark name.

By default, bookmarks are displayed to list web pages and forms. These will be displayed even if you delete all bookmarks.

Note: the bookmarks list is stored in the browser, if you use multiple browsers set your bookmarks in all of them.
