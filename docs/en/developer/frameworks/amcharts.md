# Amcharts

Library [amcharts](https://www.amcharts.com/) is used to display graphs. If you do not want the Amcharts logo to be displayed in the charts, you can purchase a license and enter its value in the conf. variable `amchartLicense`. If you have a commercial license for WebJET CMS the license is automatically entered.

You can read about initialization and usage in [Amcharts initialization](../frameworks/charts/frontend/README.md)
