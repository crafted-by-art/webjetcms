# Page Builder

Page Builder is a special page editing mode. In this mode the whole page is not edited but only selected parts of it. Page Builder separates text/image editing and page structure editing. This prevents you from accidentally deleting structural elements of a web page while editing its text.

During text editing, the HTML structure of the page, which is composed of blocks, is not violated `section, div.container, div.row, div.column`.

When using Page Builder, the entire text of the page is not editable, but only individual blocks (typically `div.column`).

PageBuilder mode is set in the template group or directly in the template in the field `Typ editora str√°nok`.
