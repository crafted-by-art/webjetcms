# Terminology of terms/expressions

The same terminology should be followed when writing the text. Use only the first term in the list, instead of the synonyms/ungrammatical/English terms listed.

- tab = bookmark, tab, sheet - the term tab is taken from Google Chrome
- folder = directory, folder - the term folder is taken from Windows, it is also used in Mac OS
- check box = `checkbox` - Google Translate
- progress bar = `progress bar` - Google Translate
- toolbar = `toolbar` - Google Translate

## Terminology for code

For the code, follow the nomenclature defined in [Naming cheatsheet](https://github.com/kettanaito/naming-cheatsheet). The code is written in English, including comments. Historically it also contains Slovak names and comments, but this is no longer allowed in the new code. We recommend to translate the comments into English when modifying the old class.
