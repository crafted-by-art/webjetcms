# Code coverage

> The code coverage measurement by tests expresses the percentage of code that is executed during test scenarios. The greater the percentage of code coverage by test scenarios, the lower the chance that the code contains undetected software bugs.

WebJET includes an integrated library [jacoco](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco)which keeps track of which part of the code is executed during runtime and then generates a detailed report in HTML format. In it, you can drill down through each package down to the level of java classes and methods, highlighting in detail which parts of the code were executed during the tests and which were not.
